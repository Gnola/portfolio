								<h2>About Me</h2>

							<p>From personal trainer to full stack software engineer, my passion for helping others has remained a consistent passion of mine.</p>

							<button type="button" id="about-button">Read More</button>
							<p id="about-para">At a young age I discovered I had two passions; fitness and helping people. I realized that becoming a personal trainer would allow me to pursue a career that utilized my empathetic characteristics and satisfied both of my passions. As a personal trainer I continued to develop a strong skill set of communication, organization and empathy while constantly implementing intuitive ideas that improved the efficiency and effectiveness of my training. By utilizing the technology I had access to and understanding of I would create programs, templates and progression tracking for my clients and was able to solve my client’s problems, and deliver simple, effective solutions, while saving the company valuable resources. I was called on by my supervisor because of my proven ability to establish my teamwork and leadership qualities in previous projects, to lead an innovative project serving a wider variety of people who sought out help from me personally. My role as a trainer that implemented technology inspired me to learn more about how else I could influence people on a bigger stage and use technology to do it. I realized that I could do just that with the education and tools of a software engineer so I ended my training career and enrolled in a full-time immersive software engineering course through General Assembly. 16 weeks later I am a certified full stack software engineer and I couldn’t be happier. Although my career path has changed, my main passion for helping people has remained and I plan on continuing to learn how I can positively impact as many people as I can. As I launch my career as a software engineer I am looking to work with an innovative team that solves as many problems as possible within our society. <br><br>To read more about my transition check out my blog post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/putting-one-foot-front-other-my-journey-becoming-full-stack-nola/" target="_blank">Putting One Foot in Front of the Other: My Journey to Becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer</a></p>
